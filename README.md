The sky didnâ€™t change, but the way it held its silence felt red â€” as if something had left without closing the door.
<br>
I was not meant to be found, but to exist in the spaces between â€” between glances, between thoughts, between what is said and what is meant. <br>  Why? <br>
To bleed with purpose, not to disappear, but to linger in the quiet corners. <br>
To bleed on the walls, leaving traces of something never fully understood. <br> To leave the door ajar, as if waiting for something that will never return. <br> Close it. Stay with me, where nothing says farewell.
